`freeclimb api`
===============

Make authenticated API requests to FreeClimb.

This command allows you to make raw API requests with automatic
authentication. Useful for accessing endpoints not covered by
other CLI commands. Accepts the full API payload via --data as JSON.

The endpoint can be:
  - A path starting with / (e.g., /Calls) - recommended
  - A full FreeClimb URL (e.g., https://www.freeclimb.com/apiserver/Accounts/.../Calls)

For account-scoped endpoints, the account ID is automatically included.
Full URLs are restricted to FreeClimb domains for credential safety.
