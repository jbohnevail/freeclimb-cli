`freeclimb dev`
===============

Start a full local development environment for FreeClimb.

Creates a public tunnel, a temporary FreeClimb application with webhook
URLs pointing at the tunnel, and optionally assigns a phone number.
All resources are cleaned up automatically when you stop the command.

This is the fastest way to go from zero to handling live calls/SMS locally.
