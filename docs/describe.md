`freeclimb describe`
====================

Describe available commands, flags, and arguments as machine-readable JSON.

Use this command for runtime schema introspection. AI agents can call this
to discover what the CLI accepts without parsing --help output.

Examples:
  freeclimb describe                   # List all topics
  freeclimb describe calls             # Show commands in the calls topic
  freeclimb describe calls:list        # Full schema for calls:list
  freeclimb describe --all             # Full schema for every command
