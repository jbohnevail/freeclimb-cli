## `freeclimb queue-members:dequeue QUEUEID CALLID`

Dequeue the specified Member. The Member's Call will begin executing the PerCL script returned from the callback specified in the actionUrl parameter when the Member was added.

```
USAGE
  $ freeclimb queue-members:dequeue QUEUEID CALLID [--json] [--quiet] [--fields <value>] [--dry-run] [-h]

ARGUMENTS
  QUEUEID  String that uniquely identifies the Queue that the Member belongs to.
  CALLID   ID if the Call that the Member belongs to.

FLAGS
  -h, --help            Show CLI help.
      --dry-run         Validate the request without executing it. Shows what would be sent to the API.
      --fields=<value>  Comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. Limits output to protect context
                        windows when used by agents.
